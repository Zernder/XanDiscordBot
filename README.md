# XanDiscordBot

This Discord bot does basic commands for moderation and plays music added to a "Music" folder. It also uses OpenAI 3.5 for text generation

Create a 'Music' folder, any .mp3 or .wav file you put in there will be playable with the music cog by doing /play.

Open the config.py as a text file:

BotToken = "Token Here" Replace Token Here with the discordbot token you got from the Discord dev portal.

Dev Portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications

You also need to get an OpenAI API Key and such:

https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

After that, simple run the "BotRun.bat" File.
